I worked at Vivid Travel between January 2019 and July 2019 as a Senior Software Engineer.

Vivid Travel was a small, bespoke tour operator started by the ex-CEO and ex-CTO of Travel Republic. I was asked by the CTO to join them to help them grow.
Unfortunately, the business did not prove particularly viable and was shut down.

During my time here I worked mainly on operational improvements to improve efficiencies in the over-stretched operations department. This included projects such as:

Automating shipping label generation via Royal Mail.
Automating app-generation with Vamoos.
SMS/WhatsApp integration to replace an out-of-support Twilio component in Sharepoint.

The tech stack at Vivid Travel was mainly:

C# (Core)
SQL Server
Azure (App Services, Application Insights, Azure Devops)
Salesforce
