Text-based adventure games work on a simple series of rooms and commands.
You start in the Lobby, and have access to other rooms, each containing more information.

In this game, the commands are:

LOOK - used to look at the room you are in.
LOOK <object> - used to look at a specific object, e.g. LOOK PROFILE DOOR

OPEN <door> - used to open a door and move inside that room, e.g. OPEN PROFILE

ABOUT - details on the tech used to build the game.

HELP - Shows this text.

Note that commands are not case-sensitive.

Sometimes you may encounter a character who will require you to answer a riddle before you are allowed in a room.
(Nobody said you would have it easy!)
In this instance, just type the answer when prompted.

If you come across any issues (which is likely, this is put together very quickly) then please contact me at:
