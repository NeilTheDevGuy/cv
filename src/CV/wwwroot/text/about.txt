I enjoyed playing text adventure games on the Commodore 64 as a kid, and later on with dialup MUD type games, and always fancied creating one.

I've also always had a fascination with gamifying things that shouldn't really be games. 

I once wanted a way to force updates on an Elastic Search index, so built an Arkanoid clone to represent the out-of-date data as bricks, which then triggered updates when destroyed.
Yes, it was pointless, but it was fun and made for an interesting presentation, too.

This game really came about when I was looking for a new job and thought this might help to give recruiters and hiring managers a change from a sea of boring CVs.

It was also a way of playing a little bit with Blazor WebAssembly which I was interested in having a look at.

As it turned out, I got a job far quicker than I expected, and therefore shelved this for a while. 

Then I thought I might as well finish it anyway, rather than leaving it as a YAUT (Yet Another Unfinished Thing).
